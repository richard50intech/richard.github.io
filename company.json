Also, it is important for us to let people know that amazing women engineer, coming from very different backgrounds and locations, are working at The Demo Company. Because sharing is caring, some of the female software engineers participated in exchanges with high school girls in order to pitch her job and why she loves it.</li><li><strong>Erasing biases in hiring and recruiting processes.</strong> We improved our job descriptions in order to make them more inclusive by using a gender decoder tool. Also, as part of the process, we think it is very important that any female candidate meets with a women software engineer for a coffee.</li><li><strong>Fostering skills-sharing and collaboration.</strong> The idea here is to help women share some of their experiences with one another. Also, we are organizing training for managers about unconscious bias.</li></ol><blockquote><p>\"As soon as we set up the actions, the number of women in tech saw a 60% increase over the next 3 months\"</p><p>— Patricia Doriss, Fullstack Developer &amp; Leader of the Women in Tech Initiative at The Demo Company</p></blockquote>","desc":"<h2>Mission 🚀&nbsp;</h2><p>Making demos simpler, more pleasant, and more productive.

Their goal now is to increase and structure the role and impact of diversity initiatives across all departments and geographies. From supporting education and tech awareness in schools to unconscious bias training when hiring, they are strong believers in promoting diversity and equal opportunities. They know that the proportion of women in tech positions remains low in the industry, this is why their tech leaders and CEO have made this topic a top priority.</p><p><i>— </i><a href=\"https://dashboard.50intech.com/dashboard/profile/5d0c84c7419af6003826b9fe\"><i>Caroline</i></a><i> &amp; the 50inTech team</i></p>","atsId":"criteo","atsProvider":"criteo","promotionStatus":"draft","jobPriorities":[{"$oid":"61f497b733dfb60025a15155"},{"$oid":"615dd161e4fc0a00211ed27e"},{"$oid":"61541ae9c31e0c001d05684b"},{"$oid":"61b9e206f5571f00200939c6"},{"$oid":"62047dfd66f22e000a6d6a11"},{"$oid":"619f842d7543230021e61380"},{"$oid":"61541af0c31e0c001d056f2d"},{"$oid":"620fe8377d51b8af54510ffa"},{"$oid":"61541aefc31e0c001d056da0"}],"fetchStatus":"FETCH_STATUS_INPROGRESS","fetchedAt":{"$date":"2023-01-03T05:55:09.245Z"},"isAtsAutoPublish":true,"isTranslatable":false,"orangeJobIds":[],"website":"https://www.criteo.com/","translations":{"fr":{"oneliner":""}},"techStack":[],"genderScore":{"globalScore":83,"genderData":59,"fairCareerPath":87,"equalPay":88,"worklifeBalance":89,"deiActions":94},"matches":{"numJobMatches":37,"numJobTopMatches":33,"numUserMatches":2621,"numUserTopMatches":460},"areJobsPublished":true,"isJobPublished":false,"deiCriteria":[],"tagHash":"18fe4121d74034d219bf58a427188d970e994c3d89c09848ba17de8ae351bbc6"}

Furthermore, in support of women's education in STEM, and to promote diversity within Tech, they have partnered with ESSEC and CentraleSupelec to offer the Dataiku Scholarship for Women Leaders in Data Science. This along with their leadership training, Employee Resource Groups (ERG’s), upcoming Women in Data Science events, and other ambitions and initiatives, clearly shows their commitment to breaking down barriers to inclusion in Tech, and empowering people. It comes as no surprise that Dataiku has deservedly acquired several accolades over the past year including, Forbes America's Best Startup Employers 2021, Inc. 2021 Best Workplaces and Glassdoor Best Tech Companies For Remote Jobs In 2021.

We love that they recognise that women applicants are not as visible as men, and therefore take considerable care and effort to identify them. We also love that they encourage salary negotiation, pushing women to ask for their worth. They also use their voice to inspire change within the industry, and promote and help women in cybersecurity through their membership in Le CErcle des Femmes de la CYberSécurité (CEFCYS) association and involvement in discussing cybersecurity topics. yogosha has a high visibility of women in leadership roles, with 50% of women in managerial roles, and 40% in C-level!

The standard at Upflow is the following.</p><p>Our Talent team goal is to keep this process under 1 month.</p><h3>1. Discovery call with Talent Acquisition</h3><p>It’s all about getting to know you, what your expectations are and making sure all parties are on the same page. Hiring is a two-way street!</p><h3>2. Screening call with Hiring Manager</h3><p>It’s a casual conversation with your future manager. We’ll get deeper into your expertise and know-how. We’ll give you also a clearer view of what your day-to-day in that role be like. It’s a good opportunity to see if you’d like to work with us, as people.</p><h3>3️. Home assignment</h3><p>Your time to shine! You’ll be given a home assignment. Yes, it is designed to assess your skills. But it’s also designed to give you a better taste of what being part of Upflow is like. Again, hiring is a two-way street! Ultimately: we believe assignments are a great way to control our biases — what you do matters, not where you come from or which gender you identify to.</p><h3>4️.&nbsp;Home assignment review</h3><p>Your hiring manager will spend up to 90 minutes debriefing your case with you. Hiring managers at Upflow are looking for team players: taking and giving feedback is key at thriving with us!</p><h3>5️. Meet the team!</h3><p>At this point, you are in the driver’s seat. We’ll meet you up with at least two other peers so you can foresee yourself as part of this team. 😃</p><h3>6️.&nbsp;Founder interview</h3><p>We really want you on the team! Depending on your future role within the team, you will either meet up with Alex (CEO: Business) or Barnaby (CTPO: Product &amp; Engineering). They tell you everything about Upflow’s vision and values. It’s a privileged moment to ask questions too.</p><h3>About reference checks</h3><p>We don’t automatically ask for references. But if we do, don’t panic! We don’t base our decision upon them. Hiring managers use references mainly to understand how they can work best with you. We want to make you thrive at Upflow.</p>","values":"<h2>How we work together: our shared operating principles</h2><p>Sharing common values is great. But embodying them day-to-day in a similar fashion is even more essential. Here’s how we work together.</p><h3>We radically own our duties</h3><p>Because we are given the trust and a safe space to do it ourselves with no micromanagement, we take ultimate ownership of what we are responsible for delivering. When pitching an idea or driving a project, we always come up with a recommendation. We don’t let things fall into the cracks, we follow up. Ultimately, we take ownership of our failures, regardless of where we stand in the team.</p><h3>We work in small batches, with the long-term in mind</h3><p>We believe looking forward and striving for quick decision-making are compatible. We act today with tomorrow in mind, building processes and adopting best-in-class tools and practices early. At the same time, we are nimble. We experiment, start with an MVP, look for quick wins, and work in small batches using the 80-20 rule while supporting our decision-making with data.</p><h3>We act with intelligence and master our craft</h3><p>We bring our experience and expertise. We do the best we can do, producing qualitative output in any type of work and acting with proactive curiosity. We continuously improve to remain best-in-class, searching for the right answer to problems and being almost fanatical about validating that we have it. We strive to be sharp and aim for our judgment to be sound. We know occasional failure is part of the process, but we course correct rapidly and don’t repeat the same mistakes.</p><h3>We invest in communication, with transparency and honesty</h3><p>We value transparency. We communicate internally about the company numbers and make most information accessible to everyone. At the same time, we believe transparency does not need to be radical and to touch every single aspect of the organization to be beneficial.</p><p>We strive for honesty and embrace failure: when things are not going the right way, we say it, no bullshit — but we stay nice and ban passive-aggressive behaviors. We embrace our strong written culture and make no assumptions when communicating with each other.</p><h3>We have each other’s back</h3><p>Because we believe the group is more important than the individual, we are here for one another. We are genuinely and mutually interested in all teams’ work and output, and support each other. We always act as one team for our users, clients, and the outside world. We make ourselves the gift of feedback using radical candor every day and through recurring 360 reviews, and create safe spaces for team members to be represented (the CSE).</p>","genderScore":{"globalScore":59,"genderData":20,"fairCareerPath":50,"equalPay":63,"worklifeBalance":78,"deiActions":84}}

With a powerful team of 15 employees all over Europe, Finary is dedicated to remote work and all the benefits that come with it – for example, a great flexibility of working hours. This flexibility also applies to maternity and paternity leave. As soon as parents want to take leave or work hours that fit even better, ways are found to do so. We simply love this mindset! With an equal pay score of 92 and 75 for DE&amp;I actions, you can expect a salary that is fair for everyone, and a company culture where there is always someone to talk to.
